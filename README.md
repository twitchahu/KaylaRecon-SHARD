# KaylaRecon-SHARD

KaylaRecon-SHARD is a curated subset of the full KaylaRecon toolkit, featuring non-offensive modules designed for secure recon, forensic analysis, and stealth system diagnostics. Each module in this repository has been selected for its relevance to ethical cybersecurity work, research, and advanced system observation.

This toolkit is safe for public distribution and does not contain cyberweapons or exploit modules.

## Modules Included

### `thatcher`
**System Severance / Network Isolation**  
Severs all outbound communication on a target system, sparing only authorized SSH sessions. Designed for digital containment, sandboxing, and live asset lockdown.

Use Cases:
- Secure sandboxing of compromised or suspicious systems.
- Deployment during sensitive operations to ensure no data exfiltration.
- Field use for live asset lockdown during investigations or red team exercises.

---

### `osmiomancy`
**Filesystem Scrying & Hidden Vector Mapping**  
Inspects filesystems for anomalies, hidden persistence points, and shadow binaries. Useful for identifying rootkits, implants, and stealthy compromise points.

Use Cases:
- Digital forensics for breach investigations.
- Persistence mechanism mapping during malware analysis.
- Recon for offensive operations needing hidden footholds.

---

### `lazarus`
**Memory Dump Reanimation & Anti-Forensics Detection**  
Parses memory dumps (`.dmp`) and volatile data to identify suspicious behavior, tampering, or runtime obfuscation.
NOTE: The module name “Lazarus” is inspired by a canonical TEKKEN 8 ability, not the known Lazarus hacker group. I became aware of the group only weeks after creating and naming the module.

Use Cases:
- Esports integrity enforcement.
- Post-mortem crash and breach analysis.
- Validation of anti-forensics attempts on compromised systems.

---

### `separation`
**Service Misconfiguration & Shadow Socket Scanner**  
Detects hidden services, misrouted internal traffic, and exposed listening sockets. Emphasizes stealth observation and misconfiguration tracing.

Use Cases:
- Stealth recon in post-exploitation scenarios.
- Internal threat analysis.
- Firewall evasion and misconfig detection for security audits.
